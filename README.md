This repository contains data and analyses used in creating the manuscript "Muskrat occurrence in Rhode Island shows little evidence of land use change driving declines" 
by John Crockett, Brian Gerber, and Charles Brown.

A different repository was used for the actual analysis, but most R files in this repository should run. The major exception is the "Data Entry and Cleaning" file, which will likely run in its current form
but would not if every commented-out line was run. This file was provided mostly as a resource for understanding how its outputs were created; the relevant outputs are included in this repository.
